In this section we will discuss the work we have done and the limitations of it.

Because of the figure of the earth being an oblate spherioid, the area of our spatial cells based on latitude and longitude degrees will vary significantly dependent on the location on the surface. The area of the cells will decrease as we traverse the globe from the equator to the poles. Equal-area partitioning like HEALPix or Quad Sphere could have been used for preserving the area measure.
The pool of users from which the data is extracted is very homogenous as it only consists of Sony employees. Future work could use a more diverse pool of users as they might exhibit different behaviours in terms of mobility and in general.
