In this section we will discuss the work we have done and the limitations of it.

Because of the figure of the earth being an oblate spherioid, the area of our spatial cells based on latitude and longitude degrees will vary significantly dependent on the location on the surface. The area of the cells will decrease as we traverse the globe from the equator to the poles. Equal-area partitioning like HEALPix or Quad Sphere could have been used for preserving the area measure.
