\section{Introduction}
In recent years the popularity of sensor-driven mobile devices and the emergence of the big data revolution has facilitated the creation and analysis of large-scale datasets generated from different aspects of our daily lives. These technologies allow us to gain greater understanding of human mobility\cite{Uihmp} etc. etc. The sensors and cameras prevalent in mobile phones allow for capturing the spatiotemporal context, geotagging.

\section{Literature review}
\subsection{Inferring social ties from geographic coincidences \cite{ISTfGC}}
\textbf{Goal}\\
To which extent social ties between people can be inferred from co-occurrence in time and space, know each other. 

Furthermore, how does this likelihood depend on the spatial and temporal proximity of the co-occurrences



\textbf{Result and methods}\\
If two persons have been on a few distinct cells within the time-period \texttt{t}, it can indicate that these two persons are directly tied in the network. [p. 1, c. 1]

\textit{Framework}\\
We divide the geographic into cells of the size sxs. 
If two persons (\texttt{A \& B}) tagging a picture within the same time-period in the same cell \texttt{c}, we say the they hace a co-occurrence. If so, we count the number of distinct cells (\texttt{k}) [p. 1, c. 2]


The social tie increase strongly when \texttt{k} increase and \texttt{t} decrease. [p. 1, c. 2]
Big difference on the probability and the baseline [p. 2, c. 1]

The probability depends on the size of \texttt{s} but also depennds on the geographically enviroment (city; densely populated, or country-land) [p. 2, c. 1]


\textbf{Discussion and conclusion}\\
The conclusion is that individuals who choose to reveal small amounts of public information about the times and locations of their activities may be inadvertently sending strong signals about certain of their social ties as well. [p. 5, c. 1]
