\section{Introduction}
In recent years the popularity of sensor-driven mobile devices like phones, tablets and wearables and the emergence of the big data revolution has facilitated the creation and analysis of large-scale datasets generated from monitoring different aspects of our daily lives\cite{lazer2009life}. The mobile phone and its related technologies have made it easier to trace the movements of people over time and have resulted in numerous advancements in computational social science. It has been shown that individuals show significant regularity in their movement over time\cite{Uihmp} and that their movement can be predicted with up to 93\% probability independent of distance\cite{LoPiHM}.

In this thesis we will try to predict the social ties of users and derive a social network based on location traces and app usage data collected from an activity tracker app called Sony Lifelog[CITE].\cite{
