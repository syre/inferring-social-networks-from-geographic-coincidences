\section{Literature review}
The problem of analyzing location traces and predicting social ties and friendship have been investigated in a number of works. Crandall et al.\cite{ISTfGC} used spatiotemporal data embedded in images (geotagging) by users of Flickr and partitioned the globe into grid-like cells and time bins at different resolutions. They found that even a small number of co-occurrences was a predictor of social ties.
