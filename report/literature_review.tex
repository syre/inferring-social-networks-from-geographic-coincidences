\section{Literature review}
The problem of analyzing location traces and predicting social ties and friendship have been investigated in a number of works. Crandall et al.\cite{ISTfGC} used spatiotemporal data embedded in images (geotagging) by users of Flickr and partitioned the globe into grid-like cells and time bins at different resolutions. They found that even a small number of co-occurrences was a predictor of social ties. 
Eagle et al.\cite{eagle} investigated data collected from mobile phones given to 100 participants and looked at differences in self-reported and behavioural data as well as relationship inference. They found they were able to predict 96\% and 95\% of reciprocal friends and reciprocal nonfriends respectively based on a factor 'extra-role' found from measurements of locations, communication and of behaviour characterized of being outside the work environment.
