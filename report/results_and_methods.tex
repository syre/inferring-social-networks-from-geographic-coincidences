\section{Result and methods}\\
We have partitioned the globe into grid-like cells with a cell resolution of .001\degree, and 1-hour time resolution. 

\textcolor{red}{If two persons have been on a few distinct cells within the time-period \texttt{t}, it can indicate that these two persons are directly tied in the network. [p. 1, c. 1]}

\textit{Framework}\\
\textcolor{red}{We divide the geographic into cells of the size sxs. 
If two persons (\texttt{A \& B}) tagging a picture within the same time-period in the same cell \texttt{c}, we say the they hace a co-occurrence. If so, we count the number of distinct cells (\texttt{k}) [p. 1, c. 2]}


\textcolor{red}{The social tie increase strongly when \texttt{k} increase and \texttt{t} decrease. [p. 1, c. 2]
Big difference on the probability and the baseline [p. 2, c. 1]}

\textcolor{red}{The probability depends on the size of \texttt{s} but also depennds on the geographically enviroment (city; densely populated, or country-land) [p. 2, c. 1]}
